The eigenvalues of a graph are defined as the eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix. The set of eigenvalues of a graph is called a graph spectrum.

The largest eigenvalue absolute value in a graph is called the spectral radius of the graph, and the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix of a graph is called its algebraic connectivity.
