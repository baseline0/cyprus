# Military Intelligence

A Primer on Multiple Intelligences pp 249-262

The main characteristics of military intelligence are presented as follows [5]:
- To be effective, military intelligence has to be integrated with weapon systems and personnel to create military capability.
- Intelligence consists of collecting and assessing knowledge which is relevant to all levels of the military and the civilian leaders.
- Gaining information superiority is based on high-quality human capital and technology. 
- The intelligence mission is hampered by an inherent uncertainty, which may be reduced by good procedures and high-quality human capital, but cannot be eliminated.
- Good intelligence gathering by the rival can reduce the relevance of the nation’s own intelligence as well as the potency of its weapon systems and its overall military capability.

the principles of intelligence include

1. **Accuracy**: With accurate intelligence on the enemy’s location, capability, and intent, planning can lead to victory.
 
2. **Timeliness**: Timeliness of intelligence contributes directly to the commander’s ability to observe, orient, decide, and act and achieve victory.
 
3. **Usability**: To have value, intelligence must be tailored to meet the needs of the commander and intelligence community. To make intelligence usable, effective marketing must be applied.
 
4. **Fusion**: Fused intelligence produces the most accurate and complete picture of what is known about an activity. It draws upon the complementary strengths of signals intelligence, imagery intelligence, human intelligence (all to be explained shortly).
 
5. **Relevancy**: Intelligence has relevancy if it contributes to the commander’s ability to execute his mission at his level of military operation. It must be geared to meet the needs of commanders across the full spectrum of military operations.
 
6. **Intellectual honesty**: Intellectual honesty must extend to reporting. Intellectual honesty must drive the intelligence professional to distinguish for the commander information which is solidly grounded in fact. The commander cannot be left with uncertainty in his mind regarding what is fact and what is opinion.
   
7. **Communication**: It is the responsibility of the intelligence professional to employ the most effective way to inform the commander. Knowing the enemy’s intent, capabilities, and location has no worth if the intelligence is not well communicated.

# Abstract Intelligence
 
A Primer on Multiple Intelligences pp 201-210

Howard Gardener, an American developmental psychologist, described nine types of intelligence in 1983 [2]:
- Naturalist (nature smart)
- Musical (sound smart)
- Logical-mathematical (number/reasoning smart)
- Existential (life smart)
- Interpersonal (people smart)
- Bodily-kinesthetic (body smart)
- Linguistic (word smart)
- Intrapersonal (self smart)
- Spatial (picture smart)

Reading books aloud to children also contributes to the development of their abstract intelligence. Books expand the imagination of children and greatly help in the development of their abstract intelligence. As the children grow, so does their way of thinking.

# Business Intelligence

A Primer on Multiple Intelligences pp 191-199

BI system has following components [5].
Data Mining: Sorting through large data sets using databases, statistics, and machine learning to identify trends and establish relationships.

Big Data: We live in era of big data. BI applications extract, organize, analyze, and report large volumes of data to aid strategic and managerial decision-making.

Querying: A request for specific data or information from a database.

Data Preparation: The process of combining and structuring data in order to prepare it for analysis.

Reporting: Sharing operating and financial data analysis with decision-makers so they can draw conclusions and make decisions.

Benchmarking: Comparing current business processes and performance metrics to historical data to track performance against industry bests.

Descriptive Analytics: The interpretation of historical data to draw comparisons and better understand changes that have occurred in a business.

Statistical Analysis: Collecting the results from descriptive analytics and applying statistics in order to identify trends.

On-line Analytical Processing (OLAP): These are BI tools that are used to analyze large volumes of historical data with drill-down functionality. Information is stored in OLAP cubes and provides a multidimensional view of data.

Data Visualization: This is the use of visual representation to explore, analyze, and interpret large amounts of data. It incorporates graphs, charts, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Graphical User Interface (GUI), virtual reality, video, and animation. Data visualization technologies transform large quantitative data sets into useful information so that individuals can understand.

Data Warehouse: This provides storing of aggregated and analyzed data. It allows reports to be produced at a reasonable cost for community.

Data Management and Integration: This component prepares data to be ready for analysis and reports. It involves analyzing, reporting, and presenting tools such as on-line analytical processing (OLAP) tools which allow users access and which analyze and model business problems and share information.

Mobile BI: Software that optimizes desktop business intelligence for mobile devices. Mobile BI solutions are available with voice-enabled access.

Collaborative BI: This is the merging of business intelligence software with collaboration tools in order to streamline the sharing process.
