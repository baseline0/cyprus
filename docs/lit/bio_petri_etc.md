# Interactomes, manufacturomes and relational biology: analogies between systems biology and manufacturing systems

Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling volume 8, Article number: 19 (2011) 

We describe anticipatory systems, or long-range feed-forward chemical reaction chains, and compare them to open-loop manufacturing processes. We then close the loop by discussing metabolism-repair systems and describe the rationality of the self-referential equation f = f (f). This relationship is derived from some boundary conditions that, in molecular systems biology, can be stated as the cardinality of the following molecular sets must be about equal: metabolome, genome, proteome. We show that this conjecture is not likely correct so the problem of self-referential mappings for describing the boundary between living and nonliving systems remains an open question. We calculate a lower and upper bound for the number of edges in the molecular interaction network (the interactome) for two cellular organisms and for two manufacturomes for CMOS integrated circuit manufacturing.

 The primary, and still the main work, on category theory to biology is Rosen [3, 22, 23]. He defines it as relational biology.

# Anticipatory Systems

n biology, senescence is an almost ubiquitous property of organisms, but at present it remains one of the most poorly understood. The concept of senescence, being intimately concerned with mortality, has proved as difficult to define as life itself. Senescence is also closely related to the concepts of time and age, which we saw in Sect. 6.4 above to be exceedingly complex in themselves. Perhaps the most satisfactory working definition, which has been adopted by most of those concerned with senescence phenomena, is the following: 

**senescence is an increase in the probability of death per unit time with chronological age.**

Put somewhat more picturesquely, senescence is an increase in the force of mortality with time. Such a definition is incomplete and unsatisfactory in many ways, as we shall see; but it will serve as a point of departure. Moreover, it explicitly calls attention to the basic conceptual notions involved: time, age, mortality.

**any system possessing an anticipatory step exhibits properties which are temporally spanned** and **such a temporal spanning represents a kind of global failure which is independent of any local subsystem failures**

Under appropriate circumstances, as we have seen, the more adaptive the subsystem (i.e. the more effectively parasitic its behavior) the greater is the decline of fitness of the overall system, including the parasite. Because of the disparity of time scales in the local and global selection mechanisms, and precisely because the observables determining global fitness are generally not directly perceptible by the subsystems, the catastrophic effects ultimately generated thereby are not manifested until it is too late for the subsystems to re-adapt.

# Modelling Ammonium Transporters in Arbuscular Mycorrhiza Symbiosis

Transactions on Computational Systems Biology XIII pp 85-109

The Stochastic Calculus of Wrapped Compartments (**SCWC**) is a recently proposed variant of the Stochastic Calculus of Looping Sequences (**SCLS**), a language for the representation and simulation of biological systems. In this work we apply SCWC to model a newly discovered ammonium transporter. This transporter is believed to play a fundamental role for plant mineral acquisition, which takes place in the arbuscular mycorrhiza, the most wide-spread plant-fungus symbiosis on earth. Investigating this kind of symbiosis is considered one of the most promising ways to develop methods to nurture plants in more natural manners, avoiding the complex chemical productions used nowadays to produce artificial fertilizers.

Physarum polycephalum belongs to the species of order Physarales, subclass
Myxogastromycetidae, class Myxomycetes, division Myxostelida. It is commonly known as a true, acellular or multi-headed slime mould. Plasmodium
is a ‘vegetative’ phase, a single cell with a myriad of diploid nuclei. The plasmodium is visible to the naked eye. The plasmodium looks like an amorphous
yellowish mass with networks of protoplasmic tubes

The unique features of P. polycephalum are, following Adamatzky (2010):
• Physarum is a living, dynamical reaction-diffusion pattern formation
mechanism.
• Physarum may be considered as equivalent to a membrane bound sub
excitable system (excitation stimuli provided by chemo-attractants and
chemo-repellents).
• The complex patterning (reticulate networks, dendritic patterns) is equivalent to parts of the continuum of Turing structure patterns.
• Physarum efficiently exploits — or outsources — external computation
by the environment via the sensing and suppression of nutrient gradients
• Physarum may be regarded as a highly efficient and living micro-manipulation and micro-fluidic transport device
• The induction of pattern type is determined partly by the environment,
specifically nutrient quality and substrate hardness, dryness, etc.
• Physarum is thus a computational material based on modification of protoplasm transport by presence of external stimuli.
• Physarum is sensitive to illumination and AC electric fields and therefore
allows for parallel and non-destructive input of information
• Physarum represents results of computation by configuration of its body.

In terms of classical computing architectures, the following characteristics
can be attributed to Physarum chips:
• Massive parallelism: there are thousands of elementary processing units,
oscillatory bodies, in a slime mould colonised in a Petri dish;
• Homogeneity: Compared to classical computing devices, the components
of the Physarum computing plasmodium are remarkably uniform. The
complexity of Physarum computation occurs as an emergent property of
their local interactions, rather than complex features of individual units;
• Massive signal integration: Membrane of plasmodium is able to integrate
massive amounts of complex spatial and time-varying stimuli to effect
local changes in contraction rhythm and, ultimately, global behaviour of
the plasmodium;
• Local connections: micro-volumes and oscillatory bodies of cytoplasm
change their states, due to diffusion and reaction, depending on states
of, or concentrations of, reactants, shape and electrical charges in their
closest neighbours;
• Parallel input and output: Physarum computers by changing its shape,
can record computation optically; Physarum is light sensitive, data can
be input by localised illumination;
• Fault tolerance: being constantly in a shape changing state, Physarum
chip restores its architecture even after a substantial part of its protoplasmic network is removed.

Slime mould cannot function for 50+ years as silicon computer chip do. Such
longevity might be not necessary, cause a practical way could be to make
disposable computers from slime mold.

In laboratory-based experiments presented in Mayne and Adamatzky
(2015b) we developed a nanoscale artificial circuit components by encouraging slime mould to internalize a range of electrically active nanoparticles,
assemble them in vivo and distribute them around the plasmodium. We found
that they hybridized plasmodium is able to form biomorphic mineralized networks inside the living plasmodium and the empty trails left following its migration, both of which facilitate the transmission of electricity.
