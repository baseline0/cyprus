The Tesla Gigafactory is a major development project of the U.S. electric car
manufacturer Tesla, which cooperates with strategic partners such as Panasonic.
The Gigafactory will serve Tesla’s strategic long-term goal of producing sufficient
numbers of lithium-ion batteries, which are required to produce larger fleets of
electric vehicles in the future and to overhaul the automotive industry with sustainable energy generation.
The first Gigafactory has been located in Nevada, and construction work began in
June 2014 (Tesla 2017). At the beginning of 2017, Tesla’s Gigafactory started
producing the first batteries, even though only 30% of the entire project was finalized
at that point. With the Gigafactory concept, many new jobs have been created in the
related fields of suppliers and service providers (Auto Motor Sport 2017; Manager
magazin 2017). Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk referred to the US Gigafactory project as
Gigafactory 1, indicating that there would be additional Gigafactory projects following in the future, the next potentially in Europe (Manager Magazin 2017).
Indeed, in 2020 the construction of the European Gigafactory began in Germany
near Berlin.
On the whole, the costs for the Gigafactory project in the United States amounted
to 5 billion U.S Dollars. Tesla expects profitable improvements from that investment. The Gigafactory is supposed to produce batteries for significantly lower costs
using economies of scale, innovative manufacturing, reduction of waste, and the
simple optimization of locating most manufacturing processes under one roof.
