capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and Fama–French three factor model

One of the critical components of the CAPM is beta, which is the sensitivity of the stock’s return to the market’s return. Because of the importance of beta in many applications, such as in the calculation of the discount rate, we show how to perform a couple of analyses to test the robustness of the beta estimate. In Sect. 5.3, we show how to perform an analysis of betas over time. We show that betas are not stationary.

These are known as multi-factor models. These models include additional factors that help explain more of the variation in expected stock returns. However, most of these multi-factor models are an empirical or statistical result (i.e., they are not based on theory). A well-known example of this is the three factor model developed by Eugene Fama and Kenneth French (FF Model). In [15, Fama and French (1993)], Fama and French found that there were large return premium associated with size and value. As a proxy for size, Fama and French used the difference in returns between small and large capitalization stocks. As a proxy for value, they used the difference in returns of high and low book-to-market (i.e., value and growth stocks) stocks. Although based on the statistical results, the Fama–French model is the prevalent factor model used in academia

An event study tests the effect of new information on a firm’s stock price. Thus, event studies presume that markets are semi-strong form efficient. The semi-strong form of the EMH indicates that public information is quickly incorporated into stock prices. So, how quickly does information get incorporated into stock prices? Busse and Green [9] studied the stock price reaction to CNBC reports, and they find that stocks respond within seconds of initial mention.
