// on dissolution, rules disappear, but nested membranes stay as do particles

// particle definitions:
// exists~  a b = a and b exist without a charge as particles
// exists~ a+ b- = a exists as a particle and is positively charged,, etc.
// exists~ *a+ b = a exists as a positively charged catalyst (not consumed)

// keywords:
// [somename someparams ... ] = environment
// (somename someparams ... ) = membrane
// exists~ = particles that exist in the containing membrane
// reaction~ = a rule
// priority~ = assign a weight or a relationship between rules
//   eg. priority~ c1 >> c2 (c1 maximally chosen over c2)
// reaction as somename~ = assign a name to a reaction (for use in priority definitions)

// for the most part, whitespace doesn't matter, except that newlines
// determine when a statement ends, and spaces separate tokens
